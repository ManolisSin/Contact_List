# Reduc Application contact list
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## The development environment

To start the development server, open a terminal and run:

    $ yarn start

A browser window should open with the development environment. Otherwise go to http://localhost:3000. You need to keep this terminal window running for the development server to work.
